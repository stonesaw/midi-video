I searched for an app that would show midi as a video.  
Then I found an app that my predecessors made.  
[MIDITrail](https://osdn.net/projects/miditrail/)

But I'm just an amateur who composes on a web browser, so...  
I wanted to make a site where you can make videos **quickly** and **easily** with a **web browser**.  

### ðŸ—ƒ Library

- [ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm)  
*In gratitude to our predecessors...*
